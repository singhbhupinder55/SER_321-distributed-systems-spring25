# Assignment 3 Starter Code

## Grid Image Maker Usage

### Terminal

```
gradle runServer
```

```
gradle runClient
```

## GUI Usage

### Code

1. Create an instance of the GUI

   ```
   ClientGui main = new ClientGui();
   ```

2. Create a new game and give it a grid dimension

   ```
   // the pineapple example is 2, but choose whatever dimension of grid you want
   // you can change the dimension to see how the grid changes size
   main.newGame(2); 
   ```

*Depending on how you want to run the system, 3 and 4 can be run how you want*

3. Insert image

   ```
   // the filename is the path to an image
   // the first coordinate(0) is the row to insert in to
   // the second coordinate(1) is the column to insert in to
   // you can change coordinates to see the image move around the box
   main.insertImage("img/Pineapple-Upside-down-cake_0_1.jpg", 0, 1);
   ```

4. Show GUI

   ```
   // true makes the dialog modal meaning that all interaction allowed is 
   //   in the windows methods.
   // false makes the dialog a pop-up which allows the background program 
   //   that spawned it to continue and process in the background.
   main.show(true);
   ```

For the images: The numbering is alwas starting at 1 which is the "main" view, increasing numbers are always turning to the right. So 2 is a 90 degree right turn of 1, while 4 is a 90 degree left turn of 1. 

### ClientGui.java
#### Summary

> This is the main GUI to display the picture grid. 

#### Methods
  - show(boolean modal) :  Shows the GUI frame with the current state
     * NOTE: modal means that it opens the GUI and suspends background processes. Processing still happens in the GUI If it is desired to continue processing in the background, set modal to false.
   * newGame(int dimension) :  Start a new game with a grid of dimension x dimension size
   * insertImage(String filename, int row, int col) :  Inserts an image into the grid, this is when you know the file name, use the PicturePanel insertImage if you have a ByteStream
   * appendOutput(String message) :  Appends text to the output panel
   * submitClicked() :  Button handler for the submit button in the output panel

### PicturePanel.java

#### Summary

> This is the image grid

#### Methods

- newGame(int dimension) :  Reset the board and set grid size to dimension x dimension
- insertImage(String fname, int row, int col) :  Insert an image at (col, row)
- insertImage(ByteArrayInputStream fname, int row, int col) :  Insert an image at (col, row)

### OutputPanel.java

#### Summary

> This is the input box, submit button, and output text area panel

#### Methods

- getInputText() :  Get the input text box text
- setInputText(String newText) :  Set the input text box text
- addEventHandlers(EventHandlers handlerObj) :  Add event listeners
- appendOutput(String message) :  Add message to output text


## Client-Server Protocol

This project follows a structured **client-server protocol** to facilitate communication between the **ClientGui** and **SockServer**.

### ðŸ“Œ Message Format
Each message exchanged between the client and the server follows this structure:

```json
{
    "type": "message_type",
    "status": "ok/fail",
    "value": "message_payload"
}
 ```

### Example Requests & Responses
- Client Sends a Greeting
```json
{
    "type": "hello"
}
```

- Server Responds with a Name Request
```json
{
    "type": "request_name",
    "status": "ok",
    "value": "Hello, Please enter your name"
}
```
- Client Sends Name
```json
{
    "type": "name",
    "value": "John"
}
```

- Server Asks for Age
```json
{
    "type": "request_age",
    "status": "ok",
    "value": "Nice to meet you, John! Now, please enter your age (e.g. 25)."
}
```

### Error Handling
- If the client sends an unrecognized command or incorrect input, the server will return an error response.
- Example: Invalid Age
```json
{
    "type": "age",
    "value": "-5"
}
```

- Server Responds with Error
```json
{
    "type": "error",
    "status": "fail",
    "message": "Invalid age. Please enter a valid positive number."
}
```

- Example: Unknown Command
```json
{
    "type": "unknown_command"
}
```

- Server Responds with Error
```json
{
    "type": "error",
    "status": "fail",
    "message": "Invalid command: unknown_command"
}
```
